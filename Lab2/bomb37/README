This is bomb 37.

It belongs to stimilsina (stimilsina@unm.edu)

FOR PHASE ONE: Key You can Russia from land here in Alaska.
1. first I will put the break explode_bomb
2. second I will put the break phase_1
3. run
4. display/s $0
5. I note down the string I got,  You can Russia from land here in Alaska.
6. quit()

For Phase Two:
Key: 1 2 4 8 16 32
This phase is for loop.
here we have first element as one from line 400f67.
And each next element is twice its precendent element. Here, at line 0x 400f7ec we have,
add %eax %eax. so, each next element should be twice of the previous element.
So the answer is:  1 2 4 8 16 32

For Phase Three:
Key : 4 w 148
I did several tries randomly. But, I had the idea that middle one should be the character
once I did x/s 0x402766. which says "%d %c %d"
Line 400fe4 says that first argument should be less than or equal to 7. Since, If it is
above 7, the code jumps to explode_bomb. Based on our first argument, we jump to the 
corresponding line.
I did first argument as 4 then, I was jumped to the line 401078 here we move 0x77 to $eax
and in line 40107d we compare the 0x94 with third argument. If the third argument doesnot
equal to 0x94 we jumpe to explode_bomb. So, I kept my third argument 148 which is 0x94 in hex.
Now, I jump to 4010eb. where we compare the 0x77 with our second argument. So, I put the char
with ascii 0x77 which is w. SO, the final key is 4 w 148.


For phase Four: Key 48 4
I found $eax to be one when i gave first argument 456. so I failed the line 401174
I found $eax to be two when i gave arguments 456 789. So, i passed the line 401174 but
failed jbe in line 40117f since 787>2.
So, second argument has to bes less than 5.
Next trial: 456 4.
func is called. looks like recursive method.

with input 123 4: first I put the break point in 0x401193 and check the 4($rsp) is comparing $eax i.e
our first argument 123 with 48 which was obtained from the recursive func4 function. Since those two
number are not equal explode_bomb was called.

lets see what we get input 48 4: bomb got diffused.


For phase Five: Key 5 115
When I had 1234 as argument, I got 1 in $eax. ALso from previous scanf we can tell $eax stores
the number of argument. SO, the there should be more than one argument. This casse failed by line
4011e3.
I just realized that in 4011eb we are only considering the last 4 bit of the first argument. So, the
first number should be in between 0 to 15. And in line 401205 we have different values at the given address
for different first argument. I noted down the value at addresses 0x401205 + multiple of 4. here we need 15
to be the value to get out the loop. But also when we get out of the loop we also need to make $edx to have
15 in it.Otherwise we willnot pass the line 40121a. SO, for first argument as 5, loop gets run for 15 times
so, we have $edx = 15 since we add 1 to it in each iterations. And I found that the $ecx have the value 115
at the end of the loop. So, the second argument has to be 115 to pass the line 40121f. 

For Phase Six:
First test input: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Here I found that to jump line 401283, we must have first argument - 1 as less than or equal to 5. This
means first argument is less than or equal to 6.
Second test input:4 222 333 444 555 666
Here I found a fact that all number has to be less than or equal to 6 since, we after each inner for loop
we test next element in line 401281. So, I will be testing next values in between 1 and 6.
I just found somethin cool with the loop from line  4012b8 to 4012ce. Here we are subtracting the each
argument from 7 and replacing that argument with the result.
When I tried 2 3 1 4 5 6. At line 4012d5, I got all values replaced by 5 4 6 3 2 1.
For the last jump in line 401340, we are comparing some hex values based on the input. Test
happens until we have the right corresponding hex values.
SO, for input 2 3 1 4 5 6 I passed only two test which I think passed the test for 2 3 should be
in order. Now Lets see for input 1 2 3 4 5 6. Here I passed three test so, 1 2 3 4 5 6. Here,
I passed three test so, 1 comes before 2 and 2 comes before 3 and 3 comes before 4. Now,
with input 5 1 2 3 4 6 we passed four tests. So, first four is in right order. Now, I have to put
the 6 in right order. Which I found to be 5 1 2 3 6 4
